### Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to build a database with SQL by applying data modeling, engineering and analysis. For this assignment, we have to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 


## Results

There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables.

* Retiting Titles: A query is written and executed to create a Retirement Titles table for employees who are born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Based on the analysis, 90,398 employees are eligible for retirement.
